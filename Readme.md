# MCQs Nest
I made this example project to test the powers of HTMX for ajax loading part of the html instead of a whole page reload. I used bootstrap 5 template for the styling.
Made with Django, Faker for generating data questions, options data for demonstrating, Charts JS for showing charts and HTMX for dynamic loading of data.
